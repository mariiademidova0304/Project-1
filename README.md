#Reflection

Link not Netlify: magnificent-palmier-0cbeb0.netlify.app
Is currently not working, will try to figure out what's the problem.
1. My main challenge was figuring out how to combine Typescript and javascript: what order I should follow, should I swith between editing those and how to properly compile separate .ts files after you've modified compiled .js and don't want those to get overwritten. Not sure we were supposed to use Typescript at all
2. On the surface the project seemed not that hard, but it took a lot of time to figure a lot of details. I've expected myself to be done much earlier. But every part of the projects that you haven't thought about raises new issues.
3. I've used regex for IP that I've found on stack overflow. Link in the sources.
4. I forgot the majority of CSS and had to almost manually place my elements instead of figuring out a better structure.
5. Used a lot of code from previous SBAs.
6. Probably haven't done enough with errors - I'm still figuring those out. I've just noticed that I'm logging them and not display-ing.
7. I read initially that I need to show the location based on IP and completely forgot about domains - I'd like to finish that a little later (if I get the time).
8. There're definitely some repeated code, design isn't 100% the same - work needs to be done here.
9. I realise I'm publishing my key for API on github. My classmates told me I should be hiding that. What's done is done and I'm not sure how I can properly hide it now. Hopefully, after the project is graded I could hide it and delete all the commits?
